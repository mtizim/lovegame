# lovegame
I'm trying to rewrite a game i made a long time ago which was spaghetti code.
Also i lost the source code for that.
It's a completely new project.

I'm pretty proud of how it's coming out, and for now i think it's actually bug-free.
It's certain;y better than the old game which was made in one file.
Of course, there are limited means of interaction right now.
